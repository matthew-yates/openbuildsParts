# Openbuilds Parts

Created parametric models of some Openbuilds parts using OpenSCAD.  These were created by taking measurements off the [GrabCAD collection](https://grabcad.com/openbuilds-1) models that Openbuilds has posted.

buildPlate.scad --> model of the universal [Build Plate](https://openbuildspartstore.com/build-plate/).

cBeamEndMount.scad --> model of the [C-Beam End Mount](https://openbuildspartstore.com/c-beam-end-mount/).

vSlot2020.scad --> model of [20x20 mm V-slot linear rail](https://openbuildspartstore.com/v-slot-20x20-linear-rail/).

vSlot2040.scad --> model of [20x40 mm V-slot linear rail](https://openbuildspartstore.com/v-slot-20x40-linear-rail/).
